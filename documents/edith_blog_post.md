# From Computer Science Student to Cybersecurity Enthusiast: My TryHackMe Journey

*Published on LinkedIn | April 2025*

When I first started my Computer Science degree at Stellenbosch University, cybersecurity felt like this mysterious, almost intimidating field that only elite hackers could master. Fast forward to today, and I've just completed my TryHackMe Web Fundamentals Certification, with CompTIA Security+ in progress. Here's how I discovered my passion for cybersecurity and what I've learned along the way.

## The Spark: A Workshop That Changed Everything

It all started in June 2024 when I attended a Cybersecurity Workshop hosted by MWR at Stellenbosch University. As a second-year Computer Science student, I was curious but honestly had no idea what to expect. The workshop covered practical penetration testing techniques, and for the first time, I saw cybersecurity not as abstract theory, but as hands-on problem-solving.

The moment that hooked me was when we performed a basic SQL injection attack in a controlled environment. Seeing how a simple `' OR 1=1 --` could bypass login authentication was both fascinating and terrifying. I realized that as developers, we need to understand how attackers think to build truly secure systems.

## Building Skills Through TryHackMe

After the workshop, I dove headfirst into TryHackMe. The platform's gamified approach to learning cybersecurity really resonated with my learning style. Starting with the PreSecurity path in October 2024, I worked my way through:

### PreSecurity Certification (October 2024)
This foundation course taught me networking fundamentals and basic security concepts. Coming from a programming background, understanding how networks actually work was eye-opening. Learning about the OSI model, TCP/IP, and basic network protocols gave me a whole new perspective on how the applications I build actually communicate.

### Introduction to Cybersecurity (September 2024)
This path introduced me to different cybersecurity domains - from offensive security to digital forensics. Each room was like solving a puzzle, which really appealed to my problem-solving nature.

### Web Fundamentals (April 2025)
This was where everything clicked. Having worked as a web developer at Flare Collective, I thought I understood web security. Boy, was I wrong! Learning about OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, understanding XSS attacks, and practicing with tools like Burp Suite completely changed how I approach web development.

## Connecting the Dots: Development Meets Security

My experience as a Junior Web & App Developer at Flare Collective suddenly made much more sense through a security lens. Those best practices senior developers kept mentioning - input validation, parameterized queries, proper authentication - weren't just "good practices," they were essential security measures.

Now when I write code, I think like an attacker:
- How could someone manipulate this input field?
- Are we properly sanitizing user data?
- What happens if someone intercepts this API call?

This security-first mindset has made me a better developer overall.

## The Multilingual Advantage

Being fluent in English, Setswana, and Russian has been surprisingly helpful in cybersecurity. Many security resources and forums are in different languages, and understanding diverse perspectives on security challenges has broadened my knowledge base. Plus, threat intelligence often comes from global sources, so language skills are definitely an asset.

## Current Focus: CompTIA Security+

I'm currently working toward my CompTIA Security+ certification. Unlike the hands-on approach of TryHackMe, Security+ requires a deeper understanding of security concepts, risk management, and organizational security policies. It's challenging in a different way - less about executing exploits and more about understanding the broader security landscape.

The certification covers:
- Risk management and governance
- Network security architecture
- Identity and access management
- Incident response procedures

What I love about this journey is how it connects to my other experiences. My data science internship at Spatialedge taught me about data analysis, which is crucial for security monitoring and threat detection. My customer support role at StellenBooks developed my communication skills, which are essential when explaining security risks to non-technical stakeholders.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Security is Everyone's Responsibility
Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or customer support representative, everyone plays a role in organizational security. My diverse work experience has shown me how security touches every aspect of business operations.

### 2. Practical Experience Matters
Reading about vulnerabilities is one thing; exploiting them in a controlled environment is completely different. TryHackMe's hands-on approach taught me more in six months than years of theoretical study could have.

### 3. Stay Curious and Humble
Cybersecurity is constantly evolving. New vulnerabilities are discovered daily, and attack techniques are always advancing. The moment you think you know everything is the moment you become a liability.

### 4. Documentation is Crucial
Every TryHackMe room I completed, I documented my approach and findings. This habit has been invaluable for reinforcing learning and creating a personal knowledge base I can reference later.

## Looking Ahead

My goal is to combine my development background with cybersecurity expertise to become a security-focused developer or application security specialist. I'm particularly interested in:

- DevSecOps practices and secure CI/CD pipelines
- Static and dynamic application security testing
- Cloud security (especially Google Cloud, given my BigQuery experience)
- Threat modeling for applications

I'm also considering pursuing additional certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) or OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) to deepen my penetration testing skills.

## Why This Matters

In today's digital world, cybersecurity isn't optional - it's essential. Every application we build, every system we deploy, and every piece of data we handle needs to be secure by design. As someone who's worked across different roles - from data science to web development to customer support - I've seen firsthand how security vulnerabilities can impact entire organizations.

My journey from computer science student to cybersecurity enthusiast has taught me that security is not just about protecting systems; it's about protecting people, businesses, and the digital trust that our modern economy depends on.

Whether you're a fellow student, a developer, or someone curious about cybersecurity, I encourage you to take that first step. Start with TryHackMe, attend workshops, and most importantly, start thinking like an attacker to become a better defender.

The field is challenging, constantly evolving, and incredibly rewarding. Plus, with the global cybersecurity skills shortage, there's never been a better time to get involved.
