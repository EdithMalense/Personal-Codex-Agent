## Prompt History

### Initial Architecture Design
**Prompt**: "help me complete this project"
**AI Response**: 
Great ‚Äî I‚Äôve read through the project brief you uploaded. Here‚Äôs how we can approach completing it step by step.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Gather Your Inputs (Training Data)

You‚Äôll need:

* **Your CV/Resume** (PDF, markdown, or plain text)
* **2‚Äì3 supporting documents** that show your work/thought process:

  * A blog post, notes, or essays (if you don‚Äôt have one, we can create a short reflective ‚Äúvalues and learning style‚Äù note together).
  * README/code snippet with thoughtful comments (we can prepare this from one of your past projects, e.g., your React + Google Sheets project).
  * Optional: a short personal reflection about teamwork or debugging style.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Build the Personal Codex Agent

We‚Äôll make a **chatbot that speaks in your voice** and pulls answers from your CV + supporting docs.

Two paths:

1. **Simple version (no RAG)**

   * Fine-tune the bot‚Äôs prompt with your personal data baked in.
   * Example: use a structured context like `"Candidate Profile" + documents` fed directly.

2. **RAG version (recommended)**

   * Store your docs in a small vector DB (e.g., `faiss` or `chromadb`).
   * On each query: retrieve relevant text ‚Üí pass to LLM for context ‚Üí answer in your voice.

We can set this up in **Streamlit** for a quick UI.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: UI Deployment

* **Streamlit** (fastest) ‚Üí Deploy via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
* Or **Replit** ‚Üí interactive web app with chatbot UI.
* Or **Vercel** ‚Üí Next.js frontend, but a bit heavier.

For speed, I suggest **Streamlit**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: README + ‚ÄúShow Your Thinking‚Äù

Your README should include:

* How you built the agent (system design, setup).
* Sample Q\&A (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat kind of engineer are you?‚Äù ‚Üí pull from CV).
* What you‚Äôd improve with more time (e.g., larger dataset, more modes, better RAG).
* AI artifacts:

  * The prompts you used with me (ChatGPT) and/or Copilot.
  * Which code was AI-generated vs. manually edited.
  * Any roles you defined for sub-agents.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Optional Bonus Features

If time allows, you could add:

* **Modes**: interview mode (concise), storytelling mode (reflective), TL;DR mode.
* **Self-reflection agent**: answers about what energizes you, how you collaborate, etc.
* **Dataset extension**: drop a new doc ‚Üí automatically added to context.

---

üëâ Next step: I can **generate the starter code for your Streamlit app** (with optional RAG support), and we can then plug in your CV + supporting docs.

Do you want me to:

1. Draft the **Streamlit chatbot code** (base version now), OR
2. Help you first **prepare and structure your CV + extra documents** into a dataset for the bot?

**Implementation**: 
1. Chose to implement the RAG version to challenge myself to complete the project to my best abilities
2. Chose Streamlit for UI Deployment as it was the fastest
3. Chose to add different answering modes so user can select the tone of the response

### Initial Architecture Design
**Prompt**: "lets generate streamlit chatbot code with RAG support"
**AI Response**: Reponse was the code that is in app.py file
**Implementation**:
1. chose to have ChatGPT generate the chatbot code for me because I did not have enough time to write the code from scratch and learn certain concepts.


### Feature Development
**Prompt**: "Add personality modes to the chatbot"
**AI Response**: [Response]
**Implementation**: [Generated code and modifications]
